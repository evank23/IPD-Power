The size of PCDs allows for investigations that cannot normally be undertaken in much smaller RCTs, such as the moderating effect of a patient characteristic on the effect of an intervention. However, researchers quite often underestimate the numbers needed to detect such effects and assume that the size of the database alone guarantees adequate power for any type of investigation. In addition, power-calculation methods in this context are under-developed and not very user friendly, and researchers quite often use a rough ‘four-times as many patients needed as for the main effect’ estimate.[1]
More recently, an algebraic approximation approach was developed by Kovalchik and Cumberland and implemented in R,[2,3], in the context of individual patient data meta-analysis. However, the essential structure of a PCD dataset closely resembles that of an individual patient data meta-analysis, with patients nested in practices in the former and in studies in the latter, thus the same method should be applicable to both. Overall, Kovalchik and Cumberland found that the method performed well in simulations although it is constrained by distributional assumptions and performance deteriorated in some scenarios. More importantly, it is limited to study level moderators since the formula uses study summary statistics and cannot account for patient level moderators.
We will develop software modules in Stata and R to calculate power using simulations, a well-known but computationally taxing approach.[4] However, simulations can be a very useful alternative for complex study designs, such as investigating moderators, when power equations are unavailable or prohibitively complex.[5] We will allow for various distributional scenarios and practice- (study-) or patient-level moderators. We will also attempt to extend the methods to mediating effects using the newly introduced family of structural equation commands in Stata v12. The developed methods and software will be of use in both PCD and individual patient data meta-analysis research.
